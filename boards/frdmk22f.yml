name: 'FRDM-K22F'
display_name: 'Freedom Development Board for Kinetis K02 and K22 (100-120 MHz, 128-512 KB Flash) MCUs'
overview: '.Form-factor compatible with the Arduino R3 pin layout.Peripherals enable rapid prototyping, including a 6-axis digital accelerometer and magnetometer to create full eCompass capabilities, a tri-colored LED and 2 user push-buttons for direct interaction, and connectivity for use with Bluetooth® and 2.4 GHz radio add-on modules.OpenSDAv2 offers options for serial communication, flash programming, and run-control debugging.The FRDM-K22F is enabled with the ARM® mbed™ development platform, which means you can quickly get started designing with no downloads or installations.'
