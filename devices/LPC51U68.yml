display_name: 'High-performance, Power-efficient and Cost Sensitive Arm Cortex-M0+ MCUs'
overview: 'The LPC51U68 are ARM Cortex-M0+ based microcontrollers for embedded applications.These devices include 96 KB of on-chip SRAM, 256 KB on-chip flash, full-speed USB device interface, and I2S, three general-purpose timers, one versatile timer with PWM and many other capabilities (SCTimer/PWM), one RTC/alarm timer, one 24-bit Multi-Rate Timer (MRT), a Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT), eight flexible serial communication peripherals (each of which can be a USART, SPIs, or I2C interface), and one 12-bit 5.0 Msps ADC, and a temperature sensor. The ARM Cortex-M0+ coprocessor available on some devices is an energy-efficient and easy-to-use 32-bit core which is code- and tool-compatible with the core. The Cortex-M0+ coprocessor offers up to 100 MHz performance with a simple instruction set and reduced code size.'
