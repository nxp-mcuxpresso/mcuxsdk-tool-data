display_name: 'Ultra-Low-Power, Highly Integrated MCU'
overview: 'The Kinetis K32L2Bx MCU family combines ultra-low-power performance with a rich suite of analog, communication, timing and control peripherals (including a segment LCD controller) for applications like electronic scales, flow meters, smart meters, and thermostatsIncludes multiple flexible low-power modes, including new compute mode which reduces dynamic power by placing peripherals in an asynchronous stop mode.Features security circuitry to prevent unauthorized access to RAM and flash contents.Provides a migration path to lower and higher performance and feature integration through compatibility with other Kinetis families.Backed by robust development tools and software.'
