display_name: 'Power-Efficient Microcontrollers (MCUs) with Advanced Peripherals Based on Arm Cortex-M4 Core and Security'
overview: 'The LPC540xx/LPC54S0xx is a family of ARM Cortex-M4 based microcontrollers for embedded applications featuring a rich peripheral set with very low power consumption and enhanced debug features.&lt;br/&gt; The ARM Cortex-M4 is a 32-bit core that offers system enhancements such as low power consumption, enhanced debug features, and a high level of support block integration. The ARM Cortex-M4 CPU incorporates a 3-stage pipeline, uses a Harvard architecture with separate local instruction and data buses as well as a third bus for peripherals, and includes an internal prefetch unit that supports speculative branching. The ARM Cortex-M4 supports single-cycle digital signal processing and SIMD instructions. A hardware floating-point processor is integrated into the core.&lt;br/&gt; The LPC540xx/LPC54S0xx family includes 360 KB of on-chip SRAM, a quad SPI Flash Interface (SPIFI) for expanding program memory, one high-speed and one full-speed USB host and device controller, Ethernet AVB, LCD controller, Smart Card Interfaces, SD/MMC, CAN FD, an External Memory Controller (EMC), a DMIC subsystem with PDM microphone interface and I2S, five general-purpose timers, SCTimer/PWM, RTC/alarm timer, Multi-Rate Timer (MRT), a Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT), ten flexible serial communication peripherals (USART, SPI, I2S, I2C interface), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), 12-bit 5.0 Msamples/sec ADC, and a temperature sensor.'
